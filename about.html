        <h1>IM RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN 2021 IN DISTRICT 3 AS A TRUE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT</h1>
        As the daughter of Jordanian and Phillipino immigrants, my focus has always been 
        advocating for the less fortunate. I’m a community activist fighting to save tenants' homes,
        a small business owner advocating to save our stores, a former lawyer adept at calling out corruption, and professional figure 
        skating coach brightening the future of our children. Most of all, I’m a New Yorker committed to restoring democracy at City Hall.
        <br><br>
        As a part of a new generation of activists getting involved with electoral politics, I am not afraid 
        to call out machine lawmakers for do-nothing policies that work against the communities they represent.
        My advocacy has inspired tenants to organize, independent contractors to form collectives, and ordinary
        people to get politically-engaged. I’m here to:
        <br><br>
        Champion Tenants Rights
        <br><br>
        Save Small Businesses & Jobs
        <br><br> 
        Rally for Independent Contractors’ Rights
        <br><br>  
        Refuse Real Estate and Special Interest Money
        <br><br>  
        My husband Peter Cecere and I were owners of Red Eye Coffee, which we were forced to close due to unaffordable rents. 
        We lost our small business because we had no rights to negotiate fair lease terms, and sadly, this is not an isolated 
        case. I’ve been fighting for the Jobs Survival Act, which gives all commercial tenants a right to a long term lease 
        renewal, the right to equally negotiate fair lease terms and the right to an arbitration process if a mutual agreement 
        cannot be reached. I’m fighting to stop the landlords from passing along their property taxes to their tenants. With 
        your vote, we can hold landlords accountable.
        <br><br>
        Since Occupy Wall Street, I have been a known figure involved in political protests throughout NYC. 
        I have protested at City Council Speaker Corey Johnson’s district office, confronting him for refusing 
        to pass a bill that would save small businesses like mine. I make my voice heard, protesting against racism 
        and police brutality-- and I am an avid proponent of election integrity, striving to ensure that residents 
        in my district participate in our democracy.
        <br><br>  
        As a businesswoman, I also intend to reform inefficient agencies and cut fraud and waste while rebuilding revenue generators 
        like our small businesses.  It's time taxpayers get a break and get rid of corrupt political machines and special interests. 
        Join my fight to lower taxes!

        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>  
        As a resident of Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen for the past 28 years, my unique background as a small business owner, 
        community activist, figure skating coach and lawyer — professions outside of the political machine — make me the 
        strongest candidate for City Council in 2021. I lead with the people’s best interests at heart, and will make immediate
        changes at City Hall.
        <br><br>  
        As a small business owner, I started <i>Community Control of Land Use</i> 
        to educate and organize small business owners, pushing for legislation that would give them rights to an affordable
        and renewable lease. 
        <br><br>  
        As a figure skating coach at Chelsea Piers, I have spent 28 years teaching children the joy and discipline of figure 
        skating. I educated parents on instilling life lessons, allowing their children to fully realize their dreams. I was 
        also one of the primary organizers in a campaign to collectively organize figure skating coaches against being 
        misclassified as employees, and the founder of NYCHA Kids Skate!--  a program to teach pro bono children living in public housing.
        <br><br>
        Whether I am teaching skating students, or fighting with small businesses for progressive legislation, I have always fought for my 
        community. All of my experiences have shaped my drive to make all New York communities more just and equitable. I want to fight for 
        a home and job for every New Yorker, and guarantee quality healthcare to all. I am ready to put power back in the hands of the 
        people, and fight for my community in District 3.  
        <br><br>
        <img src = "images/mural.jpg" style = "width: 70%;">
        <h1>ORDINARY PEOPLE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THEIR VOICES ARE LOUD ENOUGH</h1>
        In 2019, I fought alongside tenants living in NYCHA Fulton, Elliott Chelsea and Harborview Houses against RAD, 
        a privatization scheme by developers to evict public housing residents — protesting in front of elected officials' homes. 
        My efforts, alongside other activists, pushed Mayor Bill DeBlasio to create a Working Group for NYCHA residents in District 
        3 — the only working group created in the city. I continue to fight for public housing by creating effective social media 
        campaigns that expose corruption and negligence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <h2>SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE PUSHES SPEAKER JOHNSON TO SAVE SMALL BUSINESS AND GIVE AN HONEST PUBLIC HEARING</h2>
        One of Marni’s significant accomplishments from running against Corey Johnson in 2017 was that he gave the Survival Act/SBJSA a 
        public hearing a year later in October 2018. The day of the public hearing, Marni organized a press conference that morning to 
        show the public hearing was a sham and rigged in favor of real estate interests. Speakers at Marni’s event — known activists 
        (including Takeback NYC, Humanscale, Professor Tom Angotti and Naureen Akhter, policy advisor for Congresswoman Alexandria 
        Ocasio-Cortez) — called for City Council and Speaker Johnson to move and pass the Survival Act, the only solution to the 
        crisis of small business closings. As a small business owner pushed out by exorbitant rents, Marni continues to push Speaker 
        Johnson and Mayor DeBlasio on this issue.
        <br><br>
        <h2>COUNCIL CHALLENGER PUSHES COREY JOHNSON TO STOP TAKING REAL ESTATE MONEY</h2>
        Another accomplishment from Marni’s first campaign in 2017 was to examine and call out Corey Johnson’s cozy relationship to real 
        estate and development special interests. Analyzing 168 individual donors, Marni’s campaign team found that 68% of his $485K in 
        campaign contributions (as of September 2017) stemmed from donors directly linked to real estate, Wall Street, nightlife and 
        corporate philanthropy — industries known for gentrifying of the district. After her relentless efforts to make such relationships
        o the public via social media, the Speaker made the decision to stop taking real estate money a year and a half later. 
        See the website: Corey Quinn for Mayor.com.
        <br><br>
        Outside of politics, Marni — a US Figure Skating Double Gold Medalist and 4-time Gay Games Gold Medalist in Ice Dance -- coaches 
        the nationally-ranked bronze medalist skating team, the Sky Rink All Stars. The All Stars, consecutive US Figure Skating Showcase 
        National Medalists from 2013 to 2019, are one of the most decorated teams in the nation. She also created NYCHA Kids Skate!, a 
        pro-bono program to teach children from public housing how to skate.
        <br><br>
        <h2>A HISTORY OF PROTESTING INJUSTICE</h2>
        Before her foray into local politics, Marni was known for creative protest, spreading progressive messages in the form of 
        performance art in the mainstream media. Her protest group, Revolution Is Sexy, founded during Occupy Wall Street, utilizer 
        her skills as a theatrical personality to raise awareness of often complicated financial issues to make digestible to the 
        public. In addition to performance, Marni also organized protests, press conferences and helped groups liaison with reporters 
        to cover issues like income inequality, universal healthcare and the racism of Donald Trump.
        <br><br>
        <h2>AN OBSERVER AND WRITER OF LOCAL POLITICS</h2>
        Frequently asked to speak on the inner workings of local politics, Ms. Halasa can be often at rallies at City Hall, the 
        Left Forum Conference and Midtown South Community Council.  Her populist political voice has been published in articles 
        and op-eds for New York Daily News, The Villager, Metro New York, Chelsea Now, Westview News, 42st Magazine and The Clinton 
        Chronicle. She was a former reporter and editor for the New York Law Journal and The Bond Buyer.
