        <h1>AS PROTESTS HIT DAY 10 IN NYC, WHATS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED?</h1>
        <h3>PIX 11 NEWS</h3>
        More than 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested or given summonses but several district attorneys in Manhattan, 
        Brooklyn and the Bronx say they will not prosecute those arrested and accused of low level offenses like unlawful 
        assembly or violating the curfew.
        <br><br>
        For demonstrator Emil Gee, these marches opened his eyes to injustice:
        “Until this happened, I didn’t engage in a conversation about Black Lives Matter,” Gee said. “How some people who don’t 
        have the privileges and need to get them,” he added.
        <br><br>
        Many demonstrating were struck by the diversity of the thousands in the crowd.
        <br><br>
        “It’s multi generational and I think the main thing it’s not just protesting police brutality, but it’s also economic 
        injustice, the ability to have affordable housing,” said Marni Halasa. “It’s a convergence of crises and people want change."
        <br><br>
        And to many in the crowd, this is just the beginning of a whole new movement.

        <h1>NEW YORK'S UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM OVERWHELMED AS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC SHUTTERS BUSINESSESS ACROSS THE STATE</h1>
        <h3>NEW YORK DAILY NEWS</h3>
        “I’ve called all the toll-free numbers, which are recordings that redirect you to a main menu or a message saying that all the operators 
        are overloaded now and to call back,” said Lee. “Can’t reach a human to help.”
        <br><br>
        David Stollings, a sound engineer at a now-shuttered Broadway theater, called the situation “a doozy.”
        <br><br>
        “I got the site to load once,” said Stollings. “Before this it was just not loading at all.”
        <br><br>
        Marnia Halasa, a Manhattan-based figure skating coach, said she was also unable to apply and became worried about paying rent.
        <br><br>
        “What if I have to blow the New York popsicle joint and run back to Ohio to live with my father?,” asked Halasa, 
        who’s lived in the city for 28 years.
        <br><br>
        It’s not clear how many New Yorkers will be left unemployed due to the pandemic — but Empire Center founder E.J. McMahon 
        said the hit could be worse than the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when roughly 370,000 people lost their jobs in a 
        more than two-year span.
